Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time.
This version of Hangman is implemented in Python.

How to Play

 1) Start the game: Run the Python script to start the game.
 2) Guess a letter: The player enters a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s). If not, a part of the hangman is drawn.
 3) Win or lose: The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn. The player loses if the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
